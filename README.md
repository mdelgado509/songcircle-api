# Songcircle: Share Your Favorite Songs

This application allows a user to sign up and share their favorite songs with other users. Upon sign-up and sign-in, users will see the home page feed, where they can see the most recent posts by other users. Users can share their favorite song title and artist and have their post be added to the feed. Users can access their own posts, where they can update or delete the songs they posted. A user can also retrieve and read the posts of another user. Users are able to change their password if necessary and sign out to exit the app. The purpouse for making this app was to build not only the client side, but the backend as well. I was inspired by what I was seeing my friends listen to on my Spotify sidebar.

## Planning Story

The most important part of my project planning phase was scaling down the initial ideas. I narrowed it down to a user that can own a single type of resource, a favorite song.

### Technologies Used

- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JavaScript

### Unsolved Problems

- Would like to eventually have an additional resource linked to the songs, such as a review (rating and comment) or location.
